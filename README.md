# DEEN

A GUI application that allows to encode, compress, hash, ... generic input data. It is meant to be a handy tool for quick encoding/decoding tasks for data to be used in other applications. It aims to be a lightweight alternative to other tools that might take a long time to startup and should not have too many dependencies.

*Note*: This code is highly experimental!
