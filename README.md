# deen

A GUI application that allows to encode, compress, hash, ... generic input data. It is meant to be a handy tool for quick encoding/decoding tasks for data to be used in other applications. It aims to be a lightweight alternative to other tools that might take a long time to startup and should not have too many dependencies.

## Compatibility

The code should be compatible with Python 2 (at least 2.7.x) and Python 3. However, deen is mainly developed for Python 3 and some features may be temporarily broken in Python 2. It is strongly recommended to use deen with Python 3.

## Installation

```bash
python setup.py install
```
